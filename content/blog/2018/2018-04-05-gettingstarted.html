<h2>Excel, R and/or Python are important for major tasks in data science projects</h2>
<p>Excel is ideally suitable for analyzing small datasets. Excel comes with limitations. An excel sheet can’t hold more than 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns. More often than not the data is prone to cross million rows.</p>
<p>If the data contains more than a million rows, we turn to data analysis languages like R or python for carrying out the transformations, analyses and modeling exercises. The limitations of these languages are the machine’s computation limitations.</p>
