Hola! I am Kiran Ganji and currently a Data Scientist at [Quantium](https://quantium.com/). I am a passionate data geek and a traveller. I typically dive deep into data to listen to what it has to say and apply the same to the life when I travel.

Graduated from [NIT Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in/) with majors in Biotechnology. Post my graduation, I worked with [LatentView Analytics](https://www.latentview.com/), [Gramener](https://gramener.com/) and [Quantium](https://quantium.com/)

I started travelling extensively only from August of 2018 and and explored quite a few places since.   
 
Currently, I live in Hyderabad and have lived in Calicut, Trivandrum, Bangalore, Chennai and Kuala Lumpur.

I built this website based on [Julia Silge's website](https://juliasilge.com). Thanks for inspiration Julia :)
