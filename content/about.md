Data science is an unique field. You have to be creative, structured and thorough and that is why I love this field. I am Kiran Ganji and currently working as an Analyst at [Gramener](https://gramener.com/). I love solving complex problems and I am an aspiring consultant. 

I like statistical programming language R, Technology, International politics and Finance. I graduated from [NIT Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in/) with majors in Biotechnology. Since my graduation I worked with [LatentView Analytics](https://www.latentview.com/) and [Gramener](https://gramener.com/)  
 
Currently, I live in Hyderabad and have lived in Calicut, Trivandrum, Bangalore, Chennai and Kuala Lumpur.

I built this website based on [Julia Silge's website](https://juliasilge.com). Thanks for inspiration Julia :)
