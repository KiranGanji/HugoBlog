      <description>The Karnataka elections are just around the corner and election analysis is the most interesting of the bunch to do in the field of analytics. The entire last week, I tried answering one question - Can we project the constituency affiliations of major contesting parties of Karnataka.
And trying to answer the question led me to the following:
Karnataka has 224 constituencies of which 169 exist from 1978 and 55 from 2008Congress won 5 out of the past 9 elections stating that it has a strong presenceOf the 224 constituencies, 91 constituencies have a medium to high probability of Congress winning them.</description>

Must-knows about linear regression:
Linear regression derives a trend line that best fits the dataThere should be linear relationship between response variable &amp;amp; predictors and predictors shouldn’t be correlatedResiduals (Actual - Fitted) should be normally distributed, have constant variance and shouldn’t be autocorrelated.</description>
