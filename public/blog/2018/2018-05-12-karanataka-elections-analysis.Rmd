The Karnataka elections are just around the corner and election analysis is the most interesting of the bunch to do in the field of analytics. The entire last week, I tried answering one question - Can we project the constituency affiliations of major contesting parties of Karnataka.

And trying to answer the question led me to the following:

- Karnataka has 224 constituencies of which 169 exist from 1978 and 55 from 2008
- Congress won 5 out of the past 9 elections stating that it has a strong presence
- Of the 224 constituencies, 91 constituencies have a medium to high probability of Congress winning them.

## Karnataka has 224 constituencies of which 169 exist from 1978 and 55 from 2008

Karnataka has 224 constituencies and had this from 1978 onwards. As the time passed, some of the constituencies' borders were redefined and given new names. In doing so, 169 of the 224 that existed from 1978 remained intact. The regions for which the borders were redefined resulted in 55 new constituencies. Below given is the map of the Karnataka constituencies outlining the existing and newly formed constituencies.

## Congress won 5 out of the past 9 elections stating that it has a strong presence

The criteria to win an election is to achieve one seat greater than 50% of the seats available. Therefore, for a party to win it needs to win atleast 113 seats. It so happens that if a party doesn't receive the required seats, other parties can support and form a government. Looking at the past elections, we see that:

- Congress won 5 out of 9 elections in the past. Years in which congress won include 1978, 1989, 1999, 2004 and 2013. 
- Of all the 9 elections, in 1983, 2004 & 2008 none of the parties received majority
	- In 1983 Janta Party formed government with the support of BJP
	- In 2004, Congress was supported by JD(S) and formed the government
	- In 2008, BJP with the support from independently contesting candidates to formed the government for the first time.



## Of the 224 constituencies, 91 constituencies have a medium to high probability of Congress winning them.

Now that we know that Congress won most of the elections, can we project what all constituencies are likely to show affiliations towards the Congress? For the 169 constituencies that exist from 1978, I assigned weights to each of the elections which decreased exponentially(Highest for latest).  For each election and constituency, I created one hot encoded variables for 3 parties, Congress, BJP and JD(S). I multiplied the assigned weights to each of the one-hot encoded values. I added the multiplied weights and divided by the sum of weights. Thus obtained score is what I defined as probability with which a particular party is affiliated to that constituency.

Once these scores are obtained, I divided them into 2 categories. Scores with *greater than or equal to 75%* and *greater than 50% and less than 75%*. These mapped on the Karnataka constituency map is shown below 

![Karnataka constituency party affiliation scores mapped](/img/Karnataka_Seat_Projections.png)

Converting the above into numbers:

- 91 constituencies show medium to strong affiliation towards Congress (47 Strong; 44 Medium)
- 25 constituencies show medium to strong affiliation towards BJP (19 Strong; 6 Medium)
- 36 constituencies show medium to strong affiliation towards JD(S) (13 Strong; 23 Medium)

Again, these constitute to only 169 constituencies and though according to this method, the election seems to favor Congress, the election can go either way depending on the performance of the unscored 55 constituencies. I will validate my projections with the results, later this month, and see how close I was with respect to this forecast :)

## Data and maps sources

Data for this analysis was obtained from [Datameet's github](https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/tree/master/assembly-elections). The maps were created using [Gramener's](https://gramener.com/) proprietary [Excel Maps tool](https://gramener.com/indiamap/). I will update the code for this analysis post the election results :)
